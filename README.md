# angular-proto

Angular's missing protocol for accessible UI.

angular-proto is a utility suite of unstyled, accessible primitives for
Angular. Each proto-primitive is meticulously designed for composability
and built on atomic behaviors that handle the hard parts-so you
can focus on building interfaces that are distinctly yours.

Build on our primitives. Or build your own.
Either way, you're building on protocol.
